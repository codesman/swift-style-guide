This is a fork of Github's document.  It is my own personal preference and I like it that way.  I will be consistent with it, unless I decide to change!

If you want to suggest a change or addition that will help accomplish
[the goals](README.md) of this style guide, please open a pull request that:

 1. Explains the guideline
 1. Demonstrates the guideline with more-or-less valid example code
 1. Justifies the guideline by explaining the rationale behind it

Just note that all suggestions are open to discussion and debate! :smile:
